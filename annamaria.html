			<h3>The search for a reliable co-pilot.<h3/>

			<p>To make it on the social web, an online presence alone isn't enough. It takes the right strategy and creative ideas to ensure your content makes a precision landing with your audience and positions your brand on the right platforms. I love being the igniter of innovative ideas, the driver to keep your social media goals strategic and clear, and the reliable co-pilot to guide you on that journey. What fuels me? Creativity, coffee and gin tonic. What inspires me? Interesting personalities and stories that create goosebump moments. <p/>
			
			<p>Even though I don't officially boast big brand names here, my digital heart beats for clients and projects from the fields of tourism, sports, sustainability and design.<p/>
			
			<p>The social media world is creative, innovative and, above all, fast-moving, so it's important to keep up and keep learning. That's why I'm continuing my studies after completing my bachelor's degree and focusing especially on content strategy and digital communication in my master's degree. Always on the pulse of time.<p/>
