	 <p style=“line-height: 120%“> Hi, my name is Julia and I fall for all sorts of plants. However, I do not only have a passion for green flatmates, I also fancy good tunes and consider myself an awesome Spotify playlist creator. So, let's combine these two favourites of mine and focus on plants and music!</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies-heading">Do plants like music?</h2>
        <p> <b>Who doesn't, as long as it's good music!</b> <br>
          Believe it or not, plant growth is affected by music. To plants, it is not primarly important if you go for Jazz, Rock or Pop music - they just love to vibe along! The vibrations created by the sound waves matter to them. In simple terms, the vibrations produce movement in the plant cells, which stimulates the plant to produce more nutrients. Which kind of music affects the growth of different kinds of plants best, is not scientifically proven (yet). Find out more on the impact of music on plant growth <a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/info/how-music-affects-plant-growth.htm">here</a>. <br/>
