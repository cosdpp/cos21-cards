        <p>First and foremost, maïté is the result of a yearlong search for the perfect partner in all matters business. Since what was searched for could not be found, maïté decided to become the solution itself. The agency aims to offer holistic solutions to its clients, going beyond the surface, digging deeper, and thereby enabling long-term relationships.</p>
<br>Secondly, I am maïté.
